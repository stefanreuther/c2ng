Major Concept Verification
==========================

PLANETSCENTRAL API. The existing API commands mostly map to microservice commands.
We need coarser granularity.
- file/lsgame or file/stat should provide enough information to build a Folder.
- file/ls should produce file hashes to allow client-side caching.
- REST API?


Minor Concept Verification
==========================

MAKETURN/SAVE.
- Still missing for Nu.

LOCAL/NETWORK WORKSPLIT.
- Set up complete game directories for network v3 games.
- Cache Nu history results locally.

SERVERS.
- Implement integrated router/server.
- Implement frontend server?
- Implement API server?

MESSAGES. Can we integrate all messages (in-game messages, PMs, activities, forum, VCR, files) into one interface?
- Make an interface that provides heading/text/parsed data/VCR.
- Cannot load everything locally, only in-game messages.
- .rss parser for update notifications?

FILER NG.
- Add transaction support: upload many files at once and commit at the end; fork dataspace for backup.

SDL2/ANDROID.
- Touch events!


Features
========

HOST PREDICTION. We can do history, doing prediction should be possible.

MORE HOSTS. Are there any left?

OBJECT FILE (*.qc) SUPPORT.

PCC1 FEATURES MISSING IN PCC2.
- data transmissions (VPA, Informer).
- data transmission settings.
- history management.


MISC
=====

INTERPRETER REWORKS.
- Constant folding. Translate '"foo" & chr(33)' into a string.

HISTORY.
- When loading history ships, clear the mission settings. Don't say the last mission of a stolen ship forever.


CLEANUP
========

- client::widgets::BusyIndicator -> ui::widgets
- client::dialogs::DirectorySelectionDialog -> ui::dialogs
