    /** Turn loader.
        Provides an interface to load and save current and historic turns and databases.

        <b>Functions returning a Task:</b>

        The returned Task object is intended to perform the required task, and then emit a callback with the result.

        These functions are permitted to execute the actual operation ahead of time and just return a dummy task.
        However, they must not confirm the operation before the return value has been invoked.

        If the Task requires some interaction, it is permitted to suspend and later resume.
        How this resumption is achieved is out of the scope of TurnLoader.
        The task must be resumed in the same thread that started it.

        Caller may decide to abort the task by destroying it.
        In this case, it needs to stop operating and drop all references.

        For now (20220116), the ability to suspend is primarily intended for user interactions, NOT for I/O.
        Should we enable that for I/O, we'd need to enable console/server programs to support resumption of a task.
        Those currently assume that local I/O does not suspend. */
