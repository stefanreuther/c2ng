PCC2ng NEWS FILE - Technical Version
====================================

  This file contains changes relevant for people building things with
  PCC2ng. User-related changes are in NEWS.txt. Script-related changes
  (e.g. new properties or commands) can be found in the scripting
  manual.


2.41.4
------

### all servers

  All servers now support the "--instance" option and can therefore be
  run in multiple parallel instances.



2.41.2
------

### all programs: testsuite

  Testsuite has been converted to a small built-in test framework, so
  we can drop the dependency to the old `cxxtest`.



2.40.13
-------

### c2host-server: game/XXXX/in/new

  The `in/new` directory is no longer used or maintained. Therefore,
  downgrading from 2.40.13 to a previous version may cause errors if
  games have been created/joined in the new version.



2.40.11
-------

### all programs: source code

  The detailed revision history is now on Github.

  Whereas previous releases often added/rewrote/removed entire files
  being ported from PCC2, the structure is now resonably stable and
  allows meaningful commits to be made.

  If you have anything to add, pull requests are welcome.



2.40.10
-------


### all programs: testsuite

  Restructured the testsuite into a number of smaller programs instead
  of a single big one to work around toolchains that cannot handle the
  big one (namely: MinGW).

  An incremental build from a previous version to 2.40.10 may fail with

    make: *** No rule to make target '../c2ng/u/t_interpreter.cpp', needed by 'tmp/u/t_interpreter.o'.  Stop.

  If this happens, just retry the build; the error (stale dependency
  file) fixes itself.



2.40.9
------

### c2play-server: STORAGE.LAUNCHERS

  STORAGE.LAUNCHERS was reporting incorrect value (off-by-one
  indexes); this has been fixed to match the CCScript
  STORAGE.LAUNCHERS property.


### all servers, c2console: command line

  The `-D` command-line option to override a configuration option now
  works as it should. Some programs (prominently, c2console) were
  requiring `--D` instead. This has been fixed, the correct syntax is
  `-DKEY=VALUE`.

  As a side effect, the options `nocron` (host) and `notx` (mailout)
  options now need to be written with two dashes (`--nocron`); they
  have always been documented this way, but were previously accepted
  with a single dash as well.


### all programs: source code

  The `main()` functions are now all under `main/`.

  The game proxies have been moved from `client/` to `game/` and no
  longer have hard dependencies to UI code. They can therefore now (in
  theory) be used to build a UI using a different toolkit.



2.40.8
------

### c2play-server: messages

  A bug preventing access to the last message has been fixed.
