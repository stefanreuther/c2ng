@page int:intro, Introduction
@in group:int:intro

PCC includes a scripting language.
The script interpreter understands a simple programming language remotely based upon newer BASIC dialects,
and extended to be useful in a VGAP context.

The scripting language is used for...
<ul class="compact">
 <li>Connecting keys and actions ("keybindings").
   You can change these bindings using the {Bind} command.</li>
 <li>Searching objects using the <a href="pcc2:search">search function</a>, and labeling objects in the starchart.</li>
 <li><a href="pcc2:taskscreen">auto tasks</a>.</li>
</ul>

The scripting language started out as a search/query language,
and evolved into a simple interpreted language in PCC 1.x.
In PCC2, the underlying technology changes a lot, but the language remains largely the same.
However, some dirty corners have been cleaned up, making the language a little more logical and consistent.

This manual documents the PCC2 version of the language.
However, I attempted to document where PCC2 and PCC 1.x differ;
a {int:index:versions|version index} is available.
PCC2 NG improves on PCC2, but the basic principles remain the same.

<h2>Structure of this Manual</h2>

<ul class="compact">
 <li>{int:basic|Basic Concepts}</li>
 <li>{int:expr|Expressions}</li>
 <li>{int:statement|Statements}</li>
 <li>{int:index|Reference}</li>

Everyone should read the Basic Concepts part.
If you wish to use Search and Labels, you need to read just the Expressions part.
If you wish to write scripts, you should also read the Statements part.
The Reference parts contains many indexes for reference.

@page int:basic:names, Names and Context
@in group:int:intro

Names identify things.
Many programming languages therefore call them <em>identifiers</em>.
A name can contain letters, digits, and the special characters "." (dot), "$" (dollar), and "_" (underscore);
it may not start with a digit or dot, and may not end with a dot, though.
PCC predefines many names you can use in various ways.
Those are called <em>properties</em> (properties of objects, such as the name of a ship) and <em>functions</em>.
You can also define your own names: <em>variables</em> and <em>subroutines</em>.

The meaning of a name depends on the current <em>context</em>.
For example, the word <tt>Mission</tt> can stand for the mission of a ship or for the mission of a starbase,
which are governed by completely different rules.
However, names have been chosen in such a way that similar things are represented by similar names.
For example, you can use <tt>Name="Ares"</tt> to search for ships and planets having that name,
and <tt>Owner$=7</tt> searches for everything owned by player 7.

The current context is determined by the place you're invoking a script from.
For example, a planet label expression is always evaluated in the context of the planet.
A search expression is evaluated in all possible contexts, as defined by your selection
in the <a href="pcc2:search">search dialog</a>.

Contexts stack.
You can temporarily open another context to look at another object's properties.
For example, using the {Find()|Find function} to find a ship, as in
<tt>Find(Ship, Name="Ares", Id)</tt>, will evaluate the test and return expressions (second and third parameter)
in ship context.
Likewise, the {int:name:with|With} command will execute commands in a specified context.

Contexts are not only established by objects.
The "outermost" context always contains all {int:name:dim:elementarycommand|global variables}.
Each executing function, subroutine or script will establish a context for its local variables.
Every name is looked up in the innermost context first.
If it is not found there, the outer contexts are considered until one provides a definition.

There are important exceptions to these rules.
For example, in <tt>Sin(30)</tt>, <tt>Sin</tt> always means the {Sin()|sine function},
no matter what context is active.
Those exceptions are:
- some {int:expr:lit|literals} and {int:expr:operators|operator keywords}
- {int:index:group:elementaryfunction|Elementary Functions}
- {int:index:group:elementarycommand|Elementary Commands}
Those always mean the same thing, regardless of the current context, and cannot be redefined.

<h2>Namespaces</h2>

In PCC2, all functions, subroutines, structures, and variables share a single namespace.
That is, if you have a global variable %A, you cannot have a function named %A at the same time.
(You can, however, have a local variable %A, and that will "shadow" the global one due to the context stack.)

In contrast, in PCC 1.x, subroutines and variables had separate namespaces,
so you could have a subroutines named the same as a variable.
However, this is confusing and hard to use, so it should be avoided.

In both versions, the following have namespaces separate from variables and subroutines:
- hooks ({On}, {RunHook})
- keymaps ({Bind}, {CreateKeymap})
That is, defining a keymap %ShipScreen will not interfere with a command, variable or hook named %ShipScreen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:basic:namingconv, Naming Conventions
@in group:int:intro

Property names follow some simple guidelines that aim to help you memorize properties.

The shortest name always gives a nice human-readable summary of an item.
For example, <tt>{Mission (Ship Property)|Mission}</tt> yields a ship's mission in text form ("Tow a ship").
By adding more words, you can ask for details.
For example, <tt>{Mission.Tow}</tt> yields the "Tow" parameter of the mission.
Alternatively, adding a dollar sign gives the internal representation.
For example, <tt>{Mission$ (Ship Property)|Mission$}</tt> yields the mission number (7).

For programming, writing search queries, etc., you will probably use the "$" forms most often.
For formatting text, you will most likely use the short standard form.

When you define your own names, it makes sense to give them a unique prefix to avoid clashes with others' names
(in case you're using scripts developed by others).

Internally, PCC uses some names starting with <tt>CC$</tt>.
Those names are undocumented and subject to change without notice.
You should not use them.
Currently, many keybindings are implemented using a <tt>CC$</tt> name.
If you want to modify such a keybinding, it's best to copy the existing one.
For example, as of beta 9, the "change primary enemy" function (<kbd>E</kbd> on ship screen)
is implemented as <tt>CC$ChangePE</tt>.
To assign this function to the <kbd>P</kbd> key, you should write
| Bind Ship "p" := Key(Ship, "e")
instead of <tt>Bind Ship "p" := "CC$ChangePE"</tt>.
This is guaranteed to keep working in future versions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:basic:types, Types
@in group:int:intro
All names, values and expressions have a type.
The type defines what you can do with the thing.
PCC internally tracks these types.
If you use a value in a way its type does not allow, PCC will show you an appropriate error message.
Here are the most important data types:

<dl>
 <di term="Numbers">
  PCC supports fractional and whole numbers (integers).
  PCC internally tracks for each value whether it's fractional or integer.
  In general, operations between integers yield integers,
  whereas operations involving a fractional number yield a fractional number.
  Some operations require their operands to be integers, many accept either kind.
  For details, see {int:index:type:int|Integers} and {int:index:type:num|Numbers}.</di>
 <di term="Boolean (Truth Values)">
  Boolean values can be %True or %False and are used to represent yes&#47;no answers,
  for example, the results of comparisons.
  Whenever PCC needs a boolean value,
  it also accepts numbers (0 means %False (everything below 0.000001, actually), other values mean %True)
  or strings (the empty string "" means %False, other values mean %True).
  Likewise, PCC also accepts booleans when it needs a number, %False converts into zero,
  %True converts into 1.
  For details, see {int:index:type:bool|Booleans}.</di>
 <di term="Strings">
  Strings can contain arbitrary text, such as the name of a starship.
  For details, see {int:index:type:str|Strings}.</di>
 <di term="Arrays and Hashes">
  These contain other objects.
  For example, <tt>Ship</tt> is an array containing all ships.
  Arrays are indexed with numbers, hashes are indexed with strings.
  For details, see {int:index:type:array|Arrays}.</di>
 <di term="Functions">
  Functions compute values from other values.
  For example, <tt>Sqrt</tt> is a function, and <tt>Sqrt(9)</tt> computes square-root-of-9.
  You can also define your own functions using the <tt>{Function}</tt> command.
  For details, see {int:index:group:elementaryfunction|Elementary Functions} and {int:index:group:function|Functions}.</di>
 <di term="Objects">
  The result of an array reference like <tt>Ship(17)</tt> is the object, ship #17.
  You can access that object's properties by adding a dot followed by a property name,
  as in <tt>Ship(17).Name</tt>, or by using it with the <tt>{With}</tt> command.</di>
</dl>

For more details, see the {int:index:types|Data Type index}, which describes these types in all their
variants along with cross-references.

A very special value is EMPTY.
This value is used for unknown values.
For example, when you don't own a ship, it will yield EMPTY for its %Cargo.N (fuel amount).
As a general rule, an operation will yield EMPTY if one of their operands are EMPTY,
and a command will not do anything if a mandatory argument is EMPTY,
but exceptions exist.
In a boolean context (<tt>{If}</tt>), EMPTY counts as %False.

Technically, subroutines and regular (=not elementary) commands are also represented as values.
The only thing you can do with those, however, is {int:statement:types|invoke them} in a command.
You cannot use them meaningfully in expressions.

<b>Note:</b> Unlike PCC 1.x, PCC2 currently permits all sorts of interesting (and dangerous) things.
For example, you can "assign" arrays, functions, and commands, as in <tt>Ship := Planet</tt> or <tt>NewLine := NewRectangle</tt>.
This will, of course, break a lot of things.
For example, when you do <tt>Ship := Planet</tt>, ships will no longer be accessible,
and the expression <tt>Ship(3)</tt> will refer to planet #3.
On the other hand, this can also be used for good, for example to pass a function name to another function
("function pointer" or "closure" as known from other programming languages).
PCC2 doesn't yet block those things.
See {int:appendix:experimental|Experimental Features} for details.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:basic:fileio, Accessing Files
@in group:int:intro

Scripts can access files.
File access works almost identical between PCC 1.x and PCC2, but many limits have been raised in PCC2.

Files must be <em>opened</em> using the <tt>{Open}</tt> command before you can work with them.
When opening, you associate a <em>file number</em> with the file.
The file number is an integer between 1 and 100 (1 and 20 in PCC 1.x).
You can assign your own file number, or use the <tt>{FreeFile()}</tt> function to get an unused one (recommended!).
When you're done with the file, you <em>close</em> it using the <tt>{Close}</tt> command.
This makes the file number available for future re-use.

In all commands, the file number is, by convention, written with a leading <tt>#</tt>.
This is optional for all file-related commands except for <tt>{Print}</tt>
(which needs the <tt>#</tt> sign to know that this is a file number, not a value to print).

Text files can be accessed using the <tt>{Input}</tt> and <tt>{Print}</tt> commands.
PCC2 will automatically convert them from the game character set.
As an exception, if they start with a UTF-8 byte order mark, they will be read as UTF-8.
PCC 1.x will access all files with the game character set.

Binary files can be accessed using the <tt>{Get}</tt> and <tt>{Put}</tt> commands.
Those transfer data to and from a special <em>data block</em> object stored in a variable.
You can dissect this data block using the <tt>{GetWord()}</tt> function and its relatives,
and modify it using <tt>{SetWord}</tt> and relatives.

For example, a %xyplan.dat file consists of records of 6 byte each.
You could read those using a script like this:
| % Open the file
| Dim fd = FreeFile()
| Open "xyplan.dat" For Input As #fd
|
| % Read coordinates
| Dim i, block, x, y
| For i:=1 To 500 Do
|   Get #fd, block, 6
|   x := GetWord(block, 0)
|   y := GetWord(block, 2)
|   Print "Planet ", i, " is at ", x, ",", y
| Next

See {int:index:type:blob|Data Type Blob} for details.

<h2>On File Names</h2>

PCC2 runs on operating systems that have different conventions how a file name looks like.
If you wish to build a file name, you should therefore use the {MakeFileName} function;
to split a file name into components, use {GetFileName} and {GetDirectoryName}.

In PCC 1.x, you could just concatenate a directory name such as {System.GameDirectory} and a file name.
This does no longer work in PCC2!

<h2>Pitfalls</h2>

In PCC 1.x, a <em>data block</em> was just a string.
In PCC2, it is a whole new data type which cannot be used with string manipulation functions
(which was possible but deprecated in PCC 1.x).

File I/O is buffered.
When you write something to a file, the change may not immediately show up on the disk.
If you open the same file on another file number, that other file number will also not immediately see the changes.
Changes will be written out when you call <tt>{Close}</tt>.

===
===  Expressions
===


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page group:int:expr, Expressions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:expr, Expressions
@in group:int:expr

Expressions compute values.
They do so by combining elementary values (literals, properties, variables) using operators and functions.
The following sections describe expressions.

- {int:expr:lit|Literals}
- {int:expr:general|General Rules}
- {int:expr:operators|Operators}
- {int:expr:functions|Functions}
- {int:expr:grammar|Formal Grammar}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:expr:lit, Expressions: Literals
@in group:int:expr

You can directly specify numbers, strings, and boolean values.
Values of other types must be created using functions.

<em>Integers and Fractional Numbers</em> can be specified as decimal numbers.
The "." is used as the decimal point.
A number is integer if it fits into a 32-bit integer number, otherwise it's treated as real.
The number &#x3c0;=3.141592 (circumference/diameter ratio of a circle) can be specified as %PI.

<em>Strings</em> can be specified in two ways:
- Using <em>single quotes</em>: the string starts with a single quote and ends at the next one.
- Using <em>double quotes</em>: those support escaping. A backslash "\" performs a special function:
  <dl>
   <di term="\n"> is a newline character.</di>
   <di term="\\"> is a backslash character.</di>
   <di term="\&quot;"> is a double-quote character.</di>
  </dl>

<em>Boolean values</em> can be specified directly as %True and %False.

<b>See also:</b> {int:basic:types|Types}, {int:index:types|Type Index}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:expr:general, Expressions: General Rules
@in group:int:expr

Expressions combine values to compute new values using {int:expr:operators|operators} or {int:expr:functions|functions}.

Most of these operators and functions return EMPTY when one of their arguments is EMPTY.
In PCC2, operations taking more than one argument usually evaluate them all
(although not necessarily from left to right),
even if the result would be known after evaluating only some.
Exceptions are explicitly specified.
This is a difference to PCC 1.x, which would sometimes stop evaluating early.

String operations are case-insensitive by default.
That is, "A" compares equal to "a".
To get case-sensitive operations, use the <tt>{StrCase()}</tt> function.
Note that only the basic latin letters are treated case-insensitively;
special characters such as "&#228;" or "&#x0434;" are always handled case-sensitive.

Some operations taking numerical operands only work with integers.
When doing arithmetic, PCC keeps track of which values are integers and which are fractions.
Arithmetic operators and "+", "-", "*" yield integers when their operands are integers,
others like "&#47;" may generate fractions even when used on integers.

If you violate the rules, for example, by comparing a number and a string,
or by using a fractional number where an integer is required, you will get an error.
The <a href="pcc2:search">Search</a> function will treat these cases as a mismatch.
Scripts will be aborted unless they catch the error with a <tt>{Try}</tt> statement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:expr:operators, Expressions: Operators
@in group:int:expr

The following table shows all operators supported by PCC2.
Operators have a certain <em>precedence</em> or <em>binding strength</em>,
which determines which parts of the expression belong to that operator.
For example, in <tt>2 + 3 * 4</tt>, the precedence of <tt>*</tt> is higher than the precedence of <tt>+</tt>,
so the multiplication is performed first.
The addition then adds <tt>2</tt> and the result of <tt>3 * 4</tt>.
The table shows operators in increasing order of precedence, i.e. later operators are evaluated
before those shown first.

<table>
 <tr><tn width="2">(1)</tn> <td width="7">a;&nbsp;b</td><td width="25">Sequence: evaluate a, discard its result, then evaluate b. This is needed very rarely, but can be useful to perform an assignment before producing the actual value in a search expression, for example.</td></tr>

<h2>Operands</h2>

Operands to operators are shown as "a" and "b" above.
The following things are possible operands:
- <a href="int:expr:lit">literals</a>.
- an expression of higher precedence, as shown in the multiplication/addition example above the table.
- an expression within parentheses.
- a {int:expr:functions|function call}.
- a variable or property.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:expr:functions, Expressions: Functions
@in group:int:expr

A function invocation has the general form
| NameOfFunction(FirstParameter, SecondParameter, ...)
There are two kinds of functions, <em>elementary functions</em> and <em>regular functions</em>.

<h2>Elementary Functions</h2>

Elementary functions are built into the interpreter core.
They perform elementary computations, much like {int:expr:operators|built-in operators}.
An elementary function is recognized whenever its name appears followed by a "(" in an expression,
even if there is a variable or property of the same name.

You cannot define own elementary functions.
Some of these functions have a special syntax, that is, parameters that don't follow regular rules,
are evaluated in a different order than for regular functions, or not at all.

See {int:index:group:elementaryfunction|Elementary Functions} for a list of elementary functions.

<h2>Regular Functions</h2>

Regular functions behave regularily: first, their parameters are evaluated,
then, the function is invoked to produce a result.

PCC comes with many regular functions predefined.
Those perform computations, or access object contexts.
In PCC2, you can also define your own functions using the {Function} command
(PCC 1.x does not allow user-defined functions).
Those functions are available globally unless a local variable or property "shadows" them.

Some contexts provide object-specific functions which are documented as properties of the object,
for example, the {HasFunction (Ship Property)|HasFunction} ship property.

See {int:index:group:function|Functions} for a list of regular global functions,
{int:index:group:context|Contexts} for a list of context functions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:expr:grammar, Expressions: Formal Grammar
@in group:int:expr

This formal grammar describes expressions.
Terminal symbols are in quotes, or described in text.
Nonterminals are underlined.

Whenever an expression is required, PCC accepts a <u>%sequence</u>.
The only exception is the {Bind} elementary command, which takes <u><tt>or-expr</tt></u>s

  This grammar rule just allows <tt>-Not a=b</tt>, which is interpreted as
  <tt>(-(Not a)) = b</tt>.
- <font color="red">2</font>: these are the boolean literals
- <font color="red">3</font>: this is a float literal
- <font color="red">4</font>: <tt>.</tt> and <tt>-></tt> have essentially the same meaning.
  However, because the dot can also be part of names, <tt>a.b</tt> is always interpreted as a single identifier.
  To access member %b of object %a, use <tt>a->b</tt>.

@page group:int:statement, Scripts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:statement, Scripts
@in group:int:statement

A script or auto task is a list of Statements (also called Commands).
Statements perform actions, or control execution of other statements.

- {int:statement:types|Statement Types}
- {int:statement:scripts|Script Files}
- {int:statement:autotasks|Auto Tasks}
- {int:statement:processes|Processes}
- {int:statement:startup|Startup} (how to add your own scripts to PCC)
- {int:statement:plugins|Plugins} (how to add package your scripts for others)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:statement:types, Scripts: Statement Types
@in group:int:statement

<h2>Elementary vs. Expression vs. Normal</h2>

<h3>Elementary Commands</h3>

PCC supports a number of Elementary Commands.
Those statements often control execution of other statements,
like the <tt>{If (Elementary Command)|If}</tt> conditional statements,
or cause them to be executed repeatedly, like the <tt>{For}</tt> loop.
Elementary Commands often have a special syntax, and special rules how to evaluate their parameters.

See {int:index:group:elementarycommand|Elementary Commands} for a list of all Elementary Commands.

<h3>Expression Statement</h3>

An expression statement consists of an {int:expr|expression} on a line by itself.
The expression is evaluated and its result discarded.
The expression therefore normally is an assignment operation, such as
| a := Ship(10).Loc.X
which is evaluated for its side-effect of changing the value of the variable %a.

If the outermost operator is an equality comparison, as in
| a = Ship(10).Loc.X
PCC automatically converts that into an assignment,
because treating it as a comparison and discarding the result would be pointless.

If the expression starts with a keyword that also is an Elementary Command,
it is interpreted as that Elementary Command
(this applies to {Dim} and {If}, which can be commands or function calls).
If you really want it as an expression, wrap it into parentheses.

<h3>Regular Commands</h3>

A regular command has the form
| NameOfCommand FirstParameter, SecondParameter, ...
The parameters are evaluated and then passed to the command.

There are a number of {int:index:group:globalcommand|Global Commands}.
You can add your own global commands by defining subroutines using the {Sub} command.
Many contexts provide object-specific commands that manipulate that object.

<h2>Multi-line vs. Single-line</h2>

Most commands are single-line commands, i.e. occupy just one line.
Such commands can be entered on the <a href="pcc2:console">Console</a>, for example.

Some Elementary Command are complex enough to need multiple lines.
For example, an {If (Elementary Command)|If/Then/Else} statement might look like this:
| If Owner$=My.Race$ Then
|   NewCircle Loc.X, Loc.Y, 10
| Else
|   NewRectangle Loc.X-10, Loc.Y-10, Loc.X+10, Loc.Y+10
| EndIf

As a general rule, a command that starts as a single-line command cannot continue as a multi-line command.
This is <font color="red">invalid</font>:
| ForEach Ship Do If Owner$=My.Race$ Then
|   Print Name
| EndIf
It must be written as
| ForEach Ship Do
|   If Owner$=My.Race$ Then
|     Print Name
|   EndIf
| Next

Multi-line commands can only be used within {int:statement:scripts|scripts}.
You cannot define your own multi-line commands.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:statement:scripts, Scripts: Script Files
@in group:int:statement

Scripts are files that contain commands.
By convention, these scripts have the file extension <tt>.q</tt>.
They are normal text files which you can create using any text editor,
such as Notepad, Emacs, etc.

Scripts can contain single-line and multi-line commands.

Scripts can contain comments: everything after a percent sign is ignored by the interpreter
(actually, the % sign can be used to terminate every statement or expression,
but it only makes sense in scripts).
Use comments to document your scripts, for example:
| % Suspend script for one turn.
| % Execution proceeds next turn (or later, when a turn is missed).
| Sub WaitOneTurn ()
|   Local t = Turn          % Save turn number
|   Do While t = Turn       % Wait until turn number changes
|     Stop
|   Loop
| EndSub

Script files must contain complete commands.
A multi-line command that started in a file must end within the same file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:statement:autotasks, Scripts: Auto Tasks
@in group:int:statement

Auto-tasks are a special kind of script which you can edit within PCC2 on the <a href="pcc2:taskscreen">Task Screens</a>.

An auto-task is a list of commands.
Commands that can change control flow, such as {If (Elementary Command)|If} or {ForEach}, are not allowed.
You can, however, define a {Sub|subroutine} and call that.

A special command is %Restart.
This command is supported in auto-tasks only, and cannot be used in normal scripts.
It will cause the auto-task to restart from the beginning.

<b>Note:</b> Internally, an auto-task is a little more than just a script containing a list of commands.
Auto-tasks provide automatic error handling.
If an auto-task contains an error, it will be stopped with a <a href="pcc2:notify">notification</a>,
and you will be given the opportunity to fix it.
A regular script will be terminated when it encounters an error.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:statement:processes, Scripts: Processes
@in group:int:statement

Normally, a script is started (with a keystroke or a command on the console), executes, and terminates.
However, you can also define scripts that run for a longer time,
{int:statement:autotasks|Auto Tasks} being the most prominent example.
Such scripts will normally do something, wait for the next turn, the continue their operation, and so on.

Such an executing {int:statement:scripts|script} or {int:statement:autotasks|auto-task} is called a process.
If you execute the same script twice, that will be two processes.

Every process has its own set of {Static|static} and {Local|local variables}.
{Shared|Shared variables} will be shared between all processes.
Whereas there is no way that one process can access another process' static and local variables,
shared variables can be changed while the process waits.

A process waits by executing the {Stop} command.
When you exit PCC, all active processes will be saved to a file
(<tt>vmX.cc</tt> in PCC 1.x, <tt>scriptX.cc</tt> in PCC2).
When you start PCC again, that file will be loaded and all processes continued.
They must now check whether they can continue, and execute another {Stop} if not.

PCC comes with a number of commands predefined that wait for certain conditions to happen,
e.g. {WaitOneTurn}, {MoveTo}.

<h3>Limitations</h3>

Processes cannot suspend at every place.
For example, if a process currently examining a {int:index:group:drawingproperty|drawing property} calls %WaitOneTurn,
it will be terminated because PCC cannot uniquely identify a drawing and find it again next turn.
In general, everything from your Result file that has an %Id can be found again, everything else can not.

Suspending will save the processes' static and local variables.
Shared variables will not be saved.
You must make sure that the woken-up processes finds them in the state they expect.
This also applies to subroutine and function definitions.
If the script tries to call a subroutine next turn, you must make sure it is available
(e.g. by defining it through your {int:statement:startup|startup script}.

<h3>Tips</h3>

Do not suspend from within {Function (Elementary Command)|functions}.
Functions can be executed, for example, from search queries,
and you wouldn't want your search query to be delayed to next turn.

You can examine and manipulate running processes using the <a href="pcc2:processmgr">Process Manager</a>.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:statement:startup, Scripts: Startup
@in group:int:statement

There are a few ways to have PCC2 execute your scripts automatically.

<ul>
 <li>Immediately after starting, PCC2 looks for a script <tt>pcc2init.q</tt>.
  <ul>
   <li><b>Windows:</b> in your profile folder, subdirectory <tt>PCC2</tt>
    (for example, <tt>C:\Documents and Settings\YourName\Application Data\PCC2</tt>
     or <tt>C:\Users\YourName\AppData\PCC2</tt>)</li>
   <li><b>Unix:</b> your home directory, subdirectory <tt>.pcc2</tt>
    (for example, <tt>/home/yourname/.pcc2</tt>)</li>
  </ul>
  Note that this directory changed in {int:index:version:pcc21.99.13|beta 13};
  previous versions look for that file directly in the profile/home directory.</li>
 <li>PCC2 also loads {int:statement:plugins|plugins}.</li>
 <li>After setting up game directory names, PCC2 looks for a script <tt>autoexec.q</tt> in your
  game directory (very similar to how PCC 1.x looks for <tt>autoexec.q</tt>).
  This file is run in the {EnterDirectory} hook.</li>
</ul>

These scripts can contain your code.
In particular, it makes sense to put the following things into your startup scripts:

<ul>
 <li>Subroutine definitions ({Sub} statement).</li>
 <li>Property definitions ({CreateShipProperty} and {CreatePlanetProperty} statements).</li>
 <li>Key bindings ({Bind} statement) that make your subroutines accessible from the graphical interface.</li>
 <li>Hook definitions ({On} statement) that execute your subroutines at various events
  (currently of interest is the <em>Load</em> event, which you can use to perform some tasks whenever
  PCC2 loads your game).</li>
</ul>

If you have written a useful script, it may make sense to wrap it as a {int:statement:plugins|plugin}.

In addition, you can load script files from the console by typing a command such as
<tt>Load "/path/to/script.q"</tt>, and you can execute subroutines by simply calling them from the console.

One big difference between PCC 1.x and PCC2 is that PCC2 has a game chooser
that allows you to load multiple games in one session.
This means that it is possible that PCC2 loads your <tt>autoexec.q</tt> file multiple times
in one session, whereas PCC 1.x will only load it once.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:statement:plugins, Scripts: Plugins
@in group:int:statement

Since 1.99.25, PCC2 supports plugins.
Plugins are a standardized way to get scripts (and resources) into PCC2 without having to manually edit files as if it were 1992.

A plugin is defined by a <tt>*.c2p</tt> file.
This file contains information about the plugin and links to the actual files that make up the plugin.
It is a regular ".ini" file that supports the following keywords:

<ul>
 <li><tt>Name = &lt;short name of plugin&gt;</tt><br />
  This is displayed in menus as the plugin title.</li>
 <li><tt>Description = &lt;long description&gt;</tt><br />
  A longer description.
  You can use multiple Description lines to produce multiple paragraphs.</li>
 <li><tt>Provides = &lt;feature&gt;, &lt;feature&gt;</tt><br />
  <tt>Requires = &lt;feature&gt;, &lt;feature&gt;</tt><br />
  Dependencies, see below.</li>
 <li><tt>File = &lt;file name&gt;</tt><br />
  A regular file that comes with the plugin.</li>
 <li><tt>ScriptFile = &lt;file name&gt;</tt><br />
  A script file that comes with the plugin.
  The file is automatically loaded as if by {Load (Elementary Command)|Load}.</li>
 <li><tt>ResourceFile = &lt;resource file&gt;</tt><br />
  A resource (*.res) file that comes with the plugin.
  The file is automatically loaded as if it were listed at the end of <tt>cc-res.cfg</tt>.</li>
 <li><tt>HelpFile = &lt;help file&gt;</tt><br />
  A help (*.xml) file that comes with the plugin.
  Help pages from that file are made available to the {UI.Help} command.</li>
 <li><tt>&lt;type&gt;File = &lt;file name&gt;</tt><br />
  For upward-compatibility, PCC2 also accepts file types it doesn't understand, and just installs them normally.</li>
 <li><tt>Exec = &lt;script command&gt;</tt><br />
  A script command that is executed when the plugin is loaded.</li>
</ul>

Order of Script/Resource/Exec is significant, i.e. an Exec command can rely on a previous Script to be loaded.

For installation, files from File/Script/Resource must reside in the same directory as the <tt>*.c2p</tt> file.
When a file <tt>myplugin.c2p</tt> file is installed, it is copied into the directory <tt>~/.pcc2/plugins/</tt>,
and the referenced files are copied to <tt>~/.pcc2/plugins/myplugin/</tt>
(different paths on Windows).

The name of the plugin definition file serves as the plugin identifier in technical contexts (scripts, command line)
see {System.Plugin}.

The Script and Exec commands will be executed within the plugin's context,
and have access to the {int:index:group:pluginproperty|plugin properties}.

PlayVCR will only load Resource files.

When uninstalling or updating a plugin, PCC2 will unload resource
files provided by the plugin, but it will not unload scripts.

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

PCC2 has a rudimentary dependency management system.
Plugins can provide and require features.
You cannot install a plugin if a dependency is missing, and you cannot remove a plugin if another one relies on it.

Each feature is a word optionally followed by a version number, for example, <tt>"Coyote"</tt> or <tt>"Acme 1.0"</tt>.
Case is not significant.
A plugin that requires a particular version number will also accept higher version numbers.

Default features:
- "PCC 2.40.6" (current PCC2 version, whichever is current)
- each plugin definition file, say, <tt>myplugin.c2p</tt>, provides the plugin identifier ("MYPLUGIN") as a feature

<h3>Zipped Plugins</h3>

For simplicity, PCC2 also allows compressing all files of a plugin (including the <tt>*.c2p</tt> file) into a single zip file.
To identify these files as plugins, we use the file extension <tt>.c2z</tt> (but normal <tt>.zip</tt> is accepted as well).
This is the standard way of distributing plugins over the web.

<h3>Unpackaged Plugins</h3>

The <a href="pcc2:plugins">plugin installer</a> and the <tt>c2plugin</tt> tool will also accept
regular script (<tt>*.q</tt>) and resource (<tt>*.res</tt>) files for installation.
They will then internally generate a plugin description.
This is useful for testing.

When you're giving away a plugin, it is strongly recommended to add a <tt>*.c2p</tt> file,
and ideally package it up as a <tt>*.c2z</tt>.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===
===  Types
===

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type Any
Functions documented to accept or return <em>Any</em> accept more than one data type.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type Array
Arrays are created using the {Dim} command.
When you call a {Sub}/{Function} taking a variable number of arguments,
those are passed in as an array as well.

@diff Arrays are supported since PCC2 1.99.12. They are not supported in PCC 1.x.

Built-in object collections such as {Ship} or {Planet} are technically not arrays,
but mostly behave like arrays.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type Blob
Data blocks (blobs for short) are used for binary file I/O.

To read a file, you use {Get} to read a block of data, and then disassemble that block using functions
{GetByte}, {GetWord}, {GetLong} and {GetStr}.
To write into a binary file, you build the block using {SetByte}, {SetWord}, {SetLong} and {SetStr},
and then write it into the file using {Put}.

@diff In PCC 1.x, blobs are actually <a href="int:index:type:str">strings</a> and are limited to 255 bytes.
PCC2 implements blobs as a separate data type, and has no size limit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type Bool
Boolean values are truth values that can be either <tt>True</tt> or <tt>False</tt>.
To get a boolean value, you can use the keywords <tt>True</tt> and <tt>False</tt>.
More often, you will create boolean values using comparisons or logical operations.

Whenever a boolean value is required, you can also use
- a number. Zero (anything less than 10^-6 in magnitude) is treated as False,
  other values are True.
- a string. The empty string "" is treated as False, other values are True.

Whenever a number is required, you can also use a boolean value.
True converts into 1, False converts into 0.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type Cargo
You often need to compute the total cost of something in minerals.
Doing this mineral-by-mineral is cumbersome, that's why there are some functions to manipulate cargo sets.
Cargo sets are nothing more than specially formatted <a href="int:index:type:str">strings</a>.

For example, the price of a Mark 8 torpedo is 1 kt of Tritanium, Molybdenum and Duranium, and 54 megacredits.
In PCC, this cost can be represented as "1tdm 54$".
The price of 13 torpedoes is then easily computed using
| CMul("1tdm 54$", 13)

A cargo set consists of a sequence of numbers followed by units (cargo types).
The following cargo types are defined:
<table>
 <tr><td>n t d m</td>     <td>The four standard minerals</td></tr>
 <tr><td>$</td>           <td>Money (megacredits)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>s</td>           <td>Supplies</td></tr>
 <tr><td>c</td>           <td>Colonist clans</td></tr>
 <tr><td>f</td>           <td>Fighters</td></tr>
 <tr><td>w</td>           <td>Torpedoes</td></tr>
</table>

Like you see in the above example, you can attach multiple units to each number
("1tdm" is one kt Tritanium, one kt Duranium, and one kt Molybdenum).
And, you can write multiple such blocks.
Note that there must not be a space between the number and the units.

For compatibility with PHost, PCC also accepts PHost's notation where a single cargo type precedes the number.
For example, the cost of a Mark 8 torpedo would be "T1 D1 M1 $54" in PHost format.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type Expr
Functions documented to accept a parameter of type <em>Expr</em> are special.
They usually evaluate these expressions in a non-standard sequence.
For example, {If()} will only evaluate the second or third argument, but never both.
These special properties are only available for elementary functions and commands.
You cannot write functions or subroutines that take <em>Expr</em> parameters.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type File
Files are referenced by numbers in PCC.
You normally use the {FreeFile()} function to obtain a currently-unused file number.
(Alternatively, you can hard-code file numbers, but this is not recommended.)

By convention, file numbers are written with a leading hash sign:
| Dim fd = FreeFile()
| Open "test.txt" For Input As #fd
In most cases, however, it is clear from context that you mean a file number, so you can omit the hash sign.
The only case where the hash sign is required is the {Print} function.

@diff The number of allowed files differs between PCC versions.
PCC2 allows file numbers from 1 to 100, PCC 1.x only allows 1..20.
(If you use {FreeFile} to obtain file numbers, you will not notice this difference,
except for being able to open more files.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type Hash
Hashes are unordered data stores indexed by a string.
Normally, a hash is created using {Dim}:
| Dim h As Hash
It can then be used like this:
| h("key") := "value"
| Print h("key")
The key must always be a string.
It is interpreted case-sensitively.
Reading keys that have never been written returns EMPTY.

You can iterate through the content of a hash using {ForEach}:
| ForEach h Do Print Key, "=", Value
See {int:index:group:hashelementproperty|Hash Element Properties} for details.

@diff Hashes are supported since PCC2 1.99.15. They are not supported in PCC 1.x.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type Hook
Commands documented to take a parameter of type <em>Hook</em> are special.
In place of the hook parameter, you specify the name of a hook (not as a string!),
for example,
| On Load Do MyAddon.Initialize
This special behaviour is only available for elementary functions and commands.
You cannot write functions or subroutines that take <em>Hook</em> parameters.

PCC offers a set of predefined hooks that run when a particular event happens.
These are documented in the group {int:index:group:hook|Hooks} (and also listed below as "properties").

Since 2.0.8 / 2.40.8, you can also specify the name of the hook as an expression using the {ByName()} pseudo-function:
| On ByName(n) Do Whatever
Here, the name of the hook is specified in variable %n.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type Int
Most functions in PCC that operate on numbers do not care whether the numbers are integral or fractional;
those are documented as taking a {int:index:type:num|Num}.
However, some operations are only sensible on integers.
Those are documented as taking type %Int, and will refuse to work with fractional numbers.
{int:index:type:bool|Bools} automatically convert to integers, where
%True converts to 1, %False to 0.

If you have a fractional number, you can use {Int} or {Round} to convert it to an integer.

In general, the result of an operation involving fractional numbers is again a fractional number,
whereas the result of an operation involving integers can be an integer if possible.

PCC 1.x and PCC2 track a value's type very closely, thus <tt>2.5*2</tt> is a fractional number
because it started out with one.
PCC2 Web relaxes these rules a little, and looks at the actual values.
In PCC2 Web, <tt>2.5*2</tt> is a valid integer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type Iterator
An iterator references a current object from a set.
Control screens observe iterators, i.e. the ship screen observes the ship iterator;
changing the iterator changes the displayed ship.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type Keymap
Functions documented to take a parameter of type <em>Keymap</em> are special.
In place of the keymap parameter, you specify the name of the keymap, as a symbol (not as a string!),
for example,
| Key(Global, "Alt-X")
This special behaviour is only available for elementary functions and commands.
You cannot write functions or subroutines that take <em>Keymap</em> parameters.

Keymaps have a separate namespace from variables,
i.e. a keymap %MyStuff and a variable %MyStuff are not related in any way.

A keymap contains a set of keystrokes and commands active in a particular context.
A keymap can have one or more parent keymaps that "extend" the keymap.
A key is looked up first in the keymap itself.
If it is not found there, it is searched for in the parents.

PCC predefines a set of keymaps.
Those are listed below as "properties".
You can define your own keymaps using {CreateKeymap}, manipulate them using {Bind}, and use them using {UseKeymap}.

Since 2.0.8 / 2.40.8, you can also specify keymap names as an expression using the {ByName()} pseudo-function:
| Bind ByName(n) "x" := "My.Command"
Here, the name of the keymap is specified in variable %n.

Predefined keymaps are defined a little different between PCC 1.x and PCC2.
The following overview applies to PCC2 and, where appropriate, also for 1.x.

<table>
 <tr><td width="18">{Global (Keymap)|Global}</td>                        <td width="17">(Base for all predefined keymaps)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>{Ship (Keymap)|Ship}</td>                                       <td>Whenever a ship is active.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>{Planet (Keymap)|Planet}</td>                                   <td>Whenever a planet is active.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>{Base (Keymap)|Base}</td>                                       <td>Whenever a base is active.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>{Fleet (Keymap)|Fleet}</td>                                     <td>Whenever a fleet is active.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>{ControlScreen (Keymap)|ControlScreen}(Global)</td>             <td>Active on all control screens.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>{ShipScreen (Keymap)|ShipScreen}(Ship, ControlScreen)</td>      <td>Active on ship screen.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>{PlanetScreen (Keymap)|PlanetScreen}(Planet, ControlScreen)</td><td>Active on planet screen.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>{BaseScreen (Keymap)|BaseScreen}(Base, ControlScreen)</td>      <td>Active on base screen.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>{FleetScreen (Keymap)|FleetScreen}(Fleet, ControlScreen)</td>   <td>Active on fleet screen.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>{HistoryScreen (Keymap)|HistoryScreen}(ControlScreen)</td>      <td>Active on ship history screen.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>{AutoTaskScreen (Keymap)|AutoTaskScreen}(ControlScreen)</td>    <td>Active on auto task screen.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>{Starchart (Keymap)|Starchart}(Global)</td>                     <td>Active on starchart.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>{ShipLock (Keymap)|ShipLock}(Ship, Starchart)</td>              <td>Active when a ship is selected in the starchart.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>{PlanetLock (Keymap)|PlanetLock}(Planet, Starchart)</td>        <td>Active when a planet is selected in the starchart.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>{UnknownPlanetLock (Keymap)|UnknownPlanetLock}(PlanetLock)</td> <td>Active when an unknown planet is selected in the starchart.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>{BaseLock (Keymap)|BaseLock}(Base, Starchart)</td>              <td>Active when a base is selected in the starchart.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>{RaceScreen (Keymap)|RaceScreen}(Global)</td>                   <td>Active on race screen.</td></tr>
 <!--<tr><td>ShipBuildScreen(Global)</td>                                <td>Active on ship build screen.</td></tr>-->
</table>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type Num
PCC supports integral and fractional numbers.
They are entered like usual, for example
| 1
| 42
| 17.4
| .99

Integral numbers have 32 bits, and a range of +/-2147483647.

Fractional numbers have 48 bits, with about 10 significant digits and a range of about +/- 10^39.
This is the precision used in data files; internally, PCC2 uses 64 bit precision.

Most operations do not care whether their numeric parameters are integral or fractional.
<a href="int:index:type:bool">Bools</a> automatically convert to numbers, where
%True converts to 1, %False to 0.

Some operations require integer numbers; those are documented as taking parameter type
<a href="int:index:type:int">Int</a>.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type Obj
An object is something that has properties.
PCC offers all game data in the form of objects.
For example, there is an object for each ship, whose properties describe that ship's type, name, mission, and so on.

<h2>Accessing Objects</h2>

To access the built-in objects, you use the {int:index:group:context|Context} functions.
For example,
| Ship(13)
| Beam(Ship(13).Beam$)

You can also create your own objects using the {Struct} and {Dim (Elementary Command)|Dim} commands.
| Struct Pair
|   First, Second
| EndStruct
| Dim p As Pair        % p now is an object

<h2>Accessing Object Properties</h2>

There are several ways to access object properties.

<b>Directly:</b> write the object name, followed by a dot, and the property name.
| Print Ship(13).Name
| Print Beam(Ship(13).Beam$).Name
Because the dot can also be part of a name, this does not work when the object is just a name.
%p.First would be interpreted as a single variable, not as a property of %p.
Therefore, you can also use <tt>-></tt> instead of the dot:
| Print p->First
| Print p->Second

<b>Using %With:</b> You can use the {With} statement to temporarily bring object properties into scope:
| With Ship(13) Do
|   Print Name        % prints the ship's name
| EndWith
| With p Do
|   Print First       % prints p->First
| EndWith

<b>Using %ForEach:</b> For context functions, you can use {ForEach} to iterate over all objects of that type.
| ForEach Ship Do
|   Print Name        % print the names of all ships
| Next
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type Reference
A Reference is a handle to an object (unit, component, etc.).
PCC2 uses References at many places, for example, to represent object lists.

A reference can be created using {Reference()} or {LocationReference()}.
You can access {@group Reference Property|reference properties}.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type RichText
Rich text is text with attributes, such as colors, font styles, etc.
PCC2 uses rich text to build parts of the graphical interface.

Rich text is created and operated upon using functions.
You cannot use standard operators such as "+" or "=" to work with rich text.

All functions that expect rich text also accept regular <a href="int:index:type:str">strings</a> instead.

@diff Rich Text is supported since PCC 1.99.21. It is not supported by PCC 1.x.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type Str
A string is a piece of text, a sequence of characters.
Strings are specified by using single or double quotes:
| "one string"
| 'another one'
Double-quoted strings allow using the "\" to insert special characters, single-quoted strings do not.
- <tt>\n</tt> inserts a newline character
- <tt>\"</tt> inserts a double-quote
- <tt>\\</tt> inserts a backslash

In PCC 1.x, strings are limited to 255 characters.
PCC2 has no such limit.

In PCC2 since 1.99.12, strings store Unicode characters.
In previous versions, strings hold the extended ASCII set used as the game character set.
For external data, this restriction still holds;
characters not in the game character set are removed because they cannot be stored.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@type Widget
Widgets are used to build dialog windows.
Widgets are created using {@group Widget Function|Widget Functions}.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===
===  Groups
===

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Beam Property

This section describes all beam weapon properties.
These can be accessed using <tt>{Beam (Function)|Beam}(id).FIELD</tt>, where the Id number is an integer between 1 and 10.
The beam number is the position of the beam in the selection list. {Beam$} in ship context yields a beam Id.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Combat Property

This section describes all combat (VCR) properties.
These can be accessed using <tt>{Vcr (Function)|Vcr}(n).FIELD</tt>, where the index %n goes from 1 to {My.VCRs}.
Alternatively, use {ForEach} to iterate through the array.

Classic combat in VGA Planets resolves combat in 1:1 pairs.
Each combat recording therefore contains a fight between two units.
Their properties are provided as %Left.XXX and %Right.XXX.

PCC2 also supports fleet combat, namely FLAK, which allows many more units in a single fight.
Therefore, each fight also has a {Unit (Combat Property)|Unit} property which is an array of
individual {int:index:group:combatparticipantproperty|combat participants}.
The total number of units in the fight is in the {NumUnits (Combat Property)|NumUnits} property.
For classic combat, this property is 2, allowing for <tt>Units(1)</tt> (corresponding to %Left.XXX),
and <tt>Units(2)</tt> (corresponding to %Right.XXX). For fleet combat, there are more elements.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Combat Participant Property

This section describes all combat participant properties.
Each unit taking part in a fight is described by one such object.
It can be accessed using <tt>{Unit (Combat Property)|Unit}(n)</tt> as a {int:index:group:combatproperty|combat property}.

For example, this code iterates through all fights, then through all units, and prints their names:
| ForEach Vcr Do ForEach Unit Do Print Name
Properties of the first and second combat participants are also accessible as %Left.Xxx and %Right.Xxx
combat properties.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Context
Each expression is evaluated in a particular context which defines which properties are available.
Using the context references, you can temporarily switch to a different context to access another object's properties.
For example, <tt>{Ship()|Ship}(2).Name</tt> yields the name of ship 2, regardless where you are.

If the argument to a context reference is out of range or EMPTY, the return value is EMPTY.
Use this to your advantage.

In addition, context references are used with the {With} statement.
There it is an error for a context reference to return EMPTY.
Context references are also used with the {ForEach} statement.
There, you do not specify an Id.
Instead, the command iterates through all objects of that type.
See {int:index:type:obj|Objects} for details.

@diff Since PCC 1.0.18, context references use singular words.
The older plural words (<tt>Ships(id)</tt>) continue to be available in PCC 1.x,
but are not available in PCC2.
Use only the singular words.
{ForEach} always used the singular words.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Drawing Command
The following commands can be used for drawings.
To execute a drawing command, use the <tt>{ForEach} Marker</tt> statement.

See also {NewMarker}, {NewLine} etc. for commands to create drawings.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Drawing Property
You can iterate through markers and other drawings using the <tt>{ForEach} Marker</tt> statement.
You can read their properties; certain properties can also be assigned-to.

Markers/drawings can be created using the PCC starchart, or with the
{NewMarker} command and its relatives.
If some property can't be changed the way you wish, simply delete the drawing and create it anew.

Scripts inside drawing context can't suspend (using {Stop}).
Markers do not have a unique handle, so PCC would not know where to wake them up again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Elementary Command
These commands are the core of the scripting system.
They allow you structuring your programs, and interacting with the interpreter.
Many of them have a special syntax.

Most of these commands have little or no knowledge of the Planets game,
for commands to interact with your game, see {int:index:group:globalcommand|Global Commands},
{int:index:group:shipcommand|Ship Commands}, {int:index:group:planetcommand|Planet Commands},
and other sections.

The names of these commands are reserved.
You cannot define own subroutines or variables named identical to elementary commands.
A line starting with the name of an elementary command is always interpreted as that elementary command,
even if there is an {int:index:group:elementaryfunction|Elementary Function} of the same name.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Elementary Function
These functions are the core of the scripting system.
They perform elementary computations, much like built-in operators.
Some of them have a special syntax.

Most of these functions have little or no knowledge of the Planets game,
for commands to interact with your game, see {int:index:group:function|Functions},
{int:index:group:context|Contexts}, and other sections.

An elementary function is recognized whenever its name appears followed by a "(" in an expression,
even if that name has been defined with a different meaning.
<tt>Z(0)</tt> will always refer to the {Z()} function, even if there is a local variable %Z.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Engine Property
This section describes all engine properties.
These can be accessed using <tt>{Engine (Context)|Engine}(id).FIELD</tt>,
where the Id number is an integer between 1 and 9.
The engine number is the position of the engine in the selection list.
{Engine$ (Ship Property)|Engine$} in ship context yields an engine Id.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Friendly Code Property
The following properties are available for friendly code definitions and can be accessed using the
{FCode (Function)|FCode()} function.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Function
These functions are available globally.

Unlike {int:index:group:elementaryfunction|Elementary Functions}, they have a regular syntax:
| NameOfFunction(FirstParameter, SecondParameter, ...)
They will always evaluate all parameters, and then execute the function.

You can define your own functions using {Function}.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Global Command
Global commands are valid virtually anywhere.
They affect the game or your turn at whole, not only one particular object.

Unlike {int:index:group:elementarycommand|Elementary Commands}, they have a regular syntax:
| NameOfCommand FirstParameter, SecondParameter, ...
They will always evaluate all parameters, and then execute the command.

You can define your own commands using {Sub}.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Global Property
Global properties are available everywhere.
They give information on the game as whole.
Basically, there are four groups:
- %System.xxx contain information on PCC and the Planets game system on your computer.
- %Turn.xxx contain information on the turn number.
- %My.xxx describe your race and your score.
- %Ships.xxx show how many ships are in the game.
- plus some others.
Many things are derived from your score, and will be wrong if the host uses a score blanker
(a program which prevents that you see your enemy's score).

Global properties can optionally be prefixed with <tt>Global.</tt>
when their name would otherwise be shadowed by another variable.

Also see {int:index:group:globalvariable|Global Variables}.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Global Variable
Global variables are available everywhere.
Unlike {int:index:group:globalproperty|Global Properties}, these are true variables that behave nicely:
you can change their values,
and you can "localize" them (using <tt>{Dim (Elementary Command)|Dim Local}</tt>) so that commands or
subroutines you call use the local version instead of the global one.

Global variables can optionally be prefixed with <tt>Global.</tt>
when their name would otherwise be shadowed by another variable.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Internal Variable
Internal variables.
Those are subject to change at any time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Hash Element Property
You can iterate through the elements of a {int:index:type:hash|Hash} using {ForEach}:
| Dim hh As Hash
| % ...
| ForEach hh Do
|   Print Key, " = ", Value
| Next
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Hook
This section describes all predefined hooks.
A hook is run when a specific event happens.
You can register commands to be executed at that event using the {On} command.

Also see {int:index:type:hook|hook cross-reference}.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Hull Property
This section describes all hull properties.
These can be accessed using <tt>{Hull (Context)|Hull}(id).FIELD</tt>,
where the hull Id is an integer between 1 and 105.
Such hull Ids can be found in a ship's {Hull$ (Ship Property)|Hull$} property,
or on the ship specification page (<kbd>S</kbd> on ship screen).

Some of these properties are also accessible in {int:index:group:shipproperty|ship context}.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Incoming Message Command
The following commands can be used for messages.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Incoming Message Property
You can iterate through your incoming messages using the <tt>{ForEach} {InMsg}</tt> statement,
and read out their text.

Scripts inside message context can't suspend (using {Stop}).
This interface is intended for reading out message texts only.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Internal
These are internal properties and commands.
They are used by the interpreter, or for the implementation of various PCC functions.
They are listed here for completeness;
you should not use these in your own scripts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Keymap
This section describes all predefined keymaps.
A keymap is defined using {CreateKeymap} and can be manipulated using {Bind}.

Also see {int:index:type:keymap|keymap cross-reference}.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Listbox Command
These commands are used when building list boxes.
See {Listbox()} for details.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Minefield Command
The following commands can be used for minefields.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Minefield Property
The following properties are available for searching and printing,
and in scripts using the <tt>{Minefield()}</tt> function and the <tt>{ForEach} Minefield</tt> command.

PCC records minefield information, and keeps it during turns.
Minefields you scanned once are managed by PCC even if you don't currently see them.
The information you get here is approximated by PCC, by assuming the minefield was left there undisturbed,
subject only to natural decay.
The %LastScan property can tell you how old the minefield is, decide for yourself if you want to trust it or not.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Mission Property
The following properties are available for mission definitions and can be accessed using the
{Mission (Function)|Mission()} function.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Planet Command
These commands are valid at planets and starbases, and can be used to manipulate these objects.

To execute a planet command, either call the script from an appropriate place
(e.g., console called on planet screen), or use the <tt>{With} Planet(id) Do</tt> command.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Planet Property
This section describes all planet properties.
These can be accessed using <tt>{Planet (Context)|Planet}(id).FIELD</tt>,
using a {ForEach} loop, and with the search and print functions.

Many planet properties are only known for own planets.
If not, they yield EMPTY, even if not explicitly stated here.
Some properties are also known and remembered for planets you visit, scan or otherwise get information about.

Starbase properties are also accessible from planets and all yield EMPTY if there is no base.

Planet properties can be prefixed with <tt>Planet.</tt>. This makes it possible
to refer to a planet property which is currently shadowed by an equally-named property of another object.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Player Property
The following properties are available during printing, when printing a "Scores" section.
They describe the score record for each player.

They are also accessible using the {Player()} function.
When no game is loaded, only the race names are known, all other properties yield EMPTY then.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Plugin Property
This section describes plugin properties.
These can be accessed using <tt>{System.Plugin}(id).FIELD</tt>.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Reference Property
This section describes all {@type Reference|reference} properties.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Reference List Operation
This section describes operations/attributes of reference lists.
A reference list is created using {ReferenceList()}.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Ship Command
These commands are valid on starships, and can be used to give orders to them.

To execute a ship command, either call the script from an appropriate place
(e.g., console called on ship screen), or use the <tt>{With} Ship(id) Do</tt> command.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Ship Property
This section describes all ship properties.
These can be accessed using <tt>{Ship (Context)|Ship}(id).FIELD</tt>,
using a {ForEach} loop, and with the search and print functions.

Many ship properties are only known for own ships.
Some are also known for visual contacts, and only a few for non-visual contacts
(you may get non-visual contacts if you receive DOS-style RST files).
Ships whose position was guessed by PCC also count as non-visual contacts.
Unknown values are EMPTY, even if not explicitly stated here.

Ship properties can be prefixed with <tt>Ship.</tt>.
This makes it possible to refer to a ship property which is currently shadowed by an
equally-named property of another object.
For example, the following is a more complicated way to say <tt>CargoUpload "300n"</tt>:
| With Planet(Orbit$) Do CargoTransfer Ship.Id, "300n"
Without the explicit <tt>Ship.</tt>, this would pass a planet Id where
{CargoTransfer (Planet Command)|CargoTransfer} expects a ship Id, which makes no sense.

Some of the ship properties can be assigned.
If that would violate any constraint of a fleet (i.e. you try to change the speed of an ordinary member),
the assignment is silently ignored.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Storm Command
These commands are valid at ion storms.

To execute an ion storm command, use the <tt>{With} {Storm (Context)|Storm}(id) Do</tt> command.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Storm Property
Ion storm properties are available for searching and printing, using the <tt>{ForEach} Storm</tt> command,
and the <tt>{Storm (Context)|Storm}(id).FIELD</tt> context.

If you're using the Windows TRN format, you usually see all current ion storms,
otherwise you only see storms which are new or in your normal scanner range.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Torpedo Property
This section describes all torpedo system properties.
These can be accessed using <tt>{Torpedo (Function)|Torpedo}(id).FIELD</tt>
and <tt>{Launcher (Function)|Launcher}(id).FIELD</tt>, where the Id number is an integer between 1 and 10.
The torpedo number is the position of the beam in the selection list. {Torp$} in ship context yields a torpedo Id.

Properties provided by %Torpedo and %Launcher are mostly identical and differ only in that
the former gives mass and cost of a torpedo, whereas the latter gives mass and cost of a launcher.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Ufo Command
These commands are valid at Ufos.

To execute an Ufo command, use the <tt>{With} {Ufo (Context)|Ufo}(id) Do</tt> command.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Ufo Property
Ufo properties are available for searching and printing, using the <tt>{ForEach} Ufo</tt> command,
and the <tt>{Ufo (Context)|Ufo}(id).FIELD</tt> context.

Ufos are provided by add-on programs and represent objects in space other than ships, planets,
minefields, and ion storms.
PCC collects and merges Ufo information from Winplan-style result files,
and PHost's "General Object" and wormholes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group File Property
File properties are accessible using the <tt>{ForEach} {DirectoryEntry}(dir)</tt> command.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Explosion Property
Explosion properties are accessible using the <tt>{ForEach} {Explosion}</tt> command.

@change Explosions are an own type with own properties in PCC2ng.
In PCC 1.x, explosions are treated as special kind of markers; PCC2 does not have them accessible to scripts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Friendly Code Property
Friendly Code properties are accessible using the {FCode()|FCode (Function)} and the <tt>{ForEach} FCode</tt> command.
They provide access to predefined friendly codes (<tt>fcodes.</tt>).

@change Explosions are an own type with own properties in PCC2ng.
In PCC 1.x, explosions are treated as special kind of markers; PCC2 does not have them accessible to scripts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Widget Function
Widget functions are used to create {@type Widget|user interface widgets}.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Auto Task Property
Auto task properties are accessed using the {AutoTask()} function or the {UI.AutoTask} property.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@group Auto Task Command
Auto task commands are accessed using the {AutoTask()} function or the {UI.AutoTask} property.
For example,
| With UI.AutoTask Do Add "WaitOneTurn"
adds a {WaitOneTurn} command to the current auto task.

<b>Note:</b> "Auto Task Commands" are commands to manipulate an auto task, not the commands you build an auto task from.
Auto tasks will contain {@group Planet Command|planet commands}, {@group Ship Command|ship commands},
and {@group Global Command|global commands}.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@version PCC 1.1.20
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@version PCC 1.1.19
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@version PCC 1.1.18
Various improvements and fixes to match the advances made with the PCC2 script interpreter:

- slight modifications to {IsSpecialFCode()}, {Random()}, {SetName}.
- {ForEach} supports iteration over all arrays (e.g. <tt>ForEach Beam Do...</tt>).
- global variables, properties, context references and functions can be prefixed with <tt>Global.</tt>.
  This is required at several places in PCC2.
  Due to the completely different structure of the interpreter in PCC 1.x,
  there are places where 1.x accepts the `Global.' prefix and PCC2 does not, and vice versa.
  Therefore, this prefix should only be used where it is required.
  The typical case looks like this:
  <pre>
    With Ship(1) Do Print Hull(Hull$).Name
  </pre>
  This will fail in PCC2, which interprets <tt>Hull</tt> as the ship's {Hull (Ship Property)|Hull} property.
  It can be made work by writing
  <pre>
    With Ship(1) Do Print Global.Hull(Hull$).Name
  </pre>
  and thus explicitly saying that you're meaning the global array of hulls, not the local `Hull' property.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@version PCC 1.1.17

- When the result of operators <tt>/</tt> and <tt>^</tt> is an integer, the result now
  will have integer type (this is to make things like <tt>BitOr(2^5, 2^10)</tt> work).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@version PCC 1.1.16

- {Score} property on starships and planets.
- Markers can now be assigned color 0 to make them invisible and inaccessible through the normal user interface.
- Accesses to properties of non-existing objects yielded an error since 1.1.12.
  they now again yield EMPTY as documented.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  <pre>
   Dim Shared Name
   With Ships(1) Do Name := "USS " & Name
  </pre>
  does no longer read the ship name (right side) but assign to the global variable (left side).
  They now both refer to the ship name (which can't yet be assigned to).
- can print backtraces on error.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@version PCC 1.0.10
- Cargo transfer.
- <tt>Planet.</tt> and <tt>Ship.</tt> prefixes for properties.
- operator names are now reserved words, so you can no longer call a variable or procedure
  %Mod (previously, you could write commands such as <tt>mod mod mod mod</tt>
  if you had a subroutine %mod and a variable %mod).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@version PCC 1.0.9
- Increased interpreter speed.
- Hooks ({On}, {RunHook}).
- Some commands for user-interface interaction.
- Changed interface of function {Cfg}. You do no longer need to know the binary formats of HConfig and PConfig.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@version PCC 1.0.7
- {Load} and subroutine invocations now also work inside one-line commands, e.g., <tt>ForEach Ship Do TweakWaypoint</tt>.
- {Stop} now works, though a bit different than described in 1.0.6.
- {Break} and {Continue} now do the Right Thing&#x2122; most of the time in one-line loops,
  but don't work in all of them.
  The use of {Break} and {Continue} in one-line loops is very little,
  so I don't want to invest much more brain resources in them.
- one-line loops can now be stopped with <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd>.
- the semantics of {BuildShip} have been changed a little.
- the semantics of the %Or and %And operators have been changed a bit,
  they are now more intuitively defined.
  Previously, <tt>Z(0) or True</tt> was EMPTY.
  now it is %True because %Or should yield true if at least one of the operands is true -- which it obviously is.
- PCC 1.0.7 runs in protected mode if possible, making much more memory available for scripts.
- there is now a task manager <kbd>Alt-Q</kbd>.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@version PCC 1.0.6
- multi-line commands.
- object references ({int:index:group:context|contexts}).
- scripts files ({Load}).

@page int:appendix:1vs2, Changes between PCC 1.x and PCC2
@in group:int:appendix

This section contains known and intentional differences between the PCC 1.x and the PCC2 version
of the scripting language.
Often, new versions of PCC 1.x or PCC2 introduce new commands, functions or properties.
Those are referenced in the {int:index:versions|Version Index}.

<h2>Major New Features</h2>

This list does not claim completeness.

- PCC2 allows {Function|user-defined functions}.
- PCC2 exposes many more functions and properties to scripts, for example {@type RichText|Rich Text} or
  {@group Mission Property|Missions}.
- PCC2 allows {Dim (Elementary Command)|array} and {@type Hash|hash} values.
- PCC2ng allows {UI.Dialog|user-defined dialogs}.

<h2>Implementation Differences</h2>

The basic principle of the script interpreter differs completely between PCC 1.x and PCC2.
Whereas PCC2 compiles a script into an internal representation before executing it
(like most script interpreters do today), PCC 1.x interprets the script line-by-line.
This allows PCC 1.x to execute scripts with much less memory than PCC2, which is an issue
for a DOS application, but is no longer relevant today.

Other differences:

- In PCC 1.x identifiers are truncated to 31 characters. PCC2 allows up to 255.
- PCC 1.x limits string values to 255 characters. PCC2 does not.
  {int:index:version:pcc1.0.18|PCC 1.0.18} can read long property fields written by PCC2,
  and truncates accordingly. PCC2 supports Unicode.
- PCC 1.x allows unterminated string constants; the constant ends at the end of the line.
  PCC2 does not allow that.
  Likewise, code that is never executed can be syntactically invalid in PCC 1.x; PCC2 does not permit that.
- PCC 1.x uses 48-bit floating point internally and externally.
  PCC2 uses 64-bit floating point internally and 48-bit externally.
- Error messages may read differently.
- In PCC 1.x, not all arguments of a function/operator may be evaluated when one of them is EMPTY
  (this is undefined, actually). PCC2 generally evaluates them all.
- PCC 1.x has a rather weird name lookup scheme.
  In particular, it does not prevent you from defining subroutines named <tt>If</tt> or similar,
  which would then break almost everything.
  PCC2 has an (almost) consistent name resolution scheme.
  {int:index:group:elementarycommand|Elementary Commands} and {int:index:group:elementaryfunction|Elementary Functions},
  many of which have a special syntax, are reserved and cannot be overridden.
  Everything else is found using regular name lookup.
- In some cases, name lookup rules can break things that used to work.
  Whereas PCC 1.x allows you to evaluate <tt>Hull(17)</tt> or even <tt>Hull(Hull$)</tt> in ship context,
  PCC2 does not, because in ship context,
  %Hull refers to the ship's {int:name:hull:shipproperty|Hull property}.
  In PCC 1.x, this worked because %Hull was an elementary function
  (all functions were elementary in PCC 1.x, except for a really small number of array properties).<br />
  I am considering implementing a hack around this, though, because it's pretty annoying.
- {Cfg()} does not distinguish Integer and Boolean options, and always returns Integer.
- <tt>{System.Err}</tt> can be localized in PCC2.
  In PCC 1.x, the last error caught using %Try/%Else was stored in a global %System.Err property.
  In PCC2, you can define a local variable of that name to catch the error messages without disturbing the caller.
- The relations between {@group Keymap|keymaps} is different.
- Script status is stored in different files with different formats between PCC1 (<tt>vmX.cc</tt>)
  and PCC2 (<tt>scriptX.cc</tt>). Script status can be interchanged between PCC2, PCC2ng, and PCC2 Web.

<h2>Unimplemented Features</h2>

- %Beams(), %Engines(), %Hulls(), %Launchers(), %Minefields(), %Planets(), %Players(), %Ships(), %Storms(), %Torpedoes():
  the plural array names are not implemented in PCC2.
  Use the singular names (e.g. {Ship()}, {Torpedo()}) instead.
  Although PCC 1.x originally introduced the plural names,
  singular names have been supported and preferred since {int:index:version:pcc1.0.18|PCC 1.0.18}.
  Their main advantage is that they are consistent between use as array for indexing, and use in %ForEach.
- <tt>Hull().Special.Str</tt>, <tt>Ship().Hull.Special.Str</tt>:
  These properties have been obsolete since PCC 1.1.12 and have just returned an empty string since then.
  PCC2 drops them entirely.
- PCC 1.x allows <tt>On xxx Do Return</tt> to exit a hook.
  Everything added after that line is not executed.
  This is not supported in PCC2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:appendix:experimental, Experimental Features
@in group:int:appendix

This section describes experimental features of the interpreter in PCC2.
They may still change their behaviour or be removed completely.
They are not generally intended for the casual user.

This section does not apply to PCC 1.x.

In this section, "subroutine" refers to a subroutine defined with {Sub}, or to a function defined with {Function}.

<h2>Subroutine and Object References</h2>

Normally, a subroutine or structure type is global:
executing a {Sub}/{Function}/{Struct} statement makes the subroutine or type available to all other scripts in the system.
Subroutines and types are defined in the same context as global variables (<tt>{Dim} Shared</tt>).

Because these things are normal objects, they can be assigned as usual:

| Sub Foo (x)
|   Print x
| EndSub
| Dim Bar := Foo

This defines a subroutine %Foo.
A variable %Bar is defined and set to %Foo, making it an alternative way to refer to this subroutine.
To call the subroutine, you could therefore use

| Foo "this"
| Bar "or this"

The same goes for arrays, objects, types, context references, etc.

| Dim a := Ship
| Dim b := a(1)
| Dim c := b->Name   % same as c := Ship(1).Name

This feature isn't widely advertised because it can easily lead to problems if used wrong:
- not all references can be saved in the <tt>scriptX.cc</tt> file when PCC2 closes and reloads.
  If such a reference appears in a process's variable when that process is about to be saved,
  the process will be terminated.
- it's possible to build cyclic references which PCC2's memory manager cannot resolve, so your
  script will leak memory if you do not resolve cycles.
- it's plenty of rope to hang yourself. For example, after "<tt>Ship := Planet</tt>",
  the reference "<tt>Ship(12)</tt>" will actually give you planet #12, and ships will no longer be accessible.

Note that this only applies to regular subroutines and builtin commands.
It does not apply to elementary commands.
It is not possible to make a variable with an alternative name for, say, %If,
and it is not possible to make %If mean anything else than the {If|default meaning}.

<h2>Local Subroutines</h2>

It is possible to define subroutines in local (subroutine scope) or static (script scope) context.

To enable the feature, use <tt>{Option} LocalSubs(1)</tt>.
Then, define subroutines using <tt>Local Sub...</tt>.
For example,

| Option LocalSubs(1)
| Sub PrintSquare(n)
|   Local Function MakeRow(n)
|     Return String(n, "X")
|   EndFunction
|   Local i
|   For i:=1 To n Do Print MakeRow(n)
| EndSub

In this example, the %MakeRow function is only defined during the execution of the %PrintSquare function.
It is not available to any other function.

Be careful that some code will be executed outside the current function. For example,
| Sub Initialize
|   Local Sub Callback    % wrong!
|     Print "something"
|   EndSub
|   On Load Do Callback   % wrong!
| EndSub
will not work. When the <tt>On Load</tt> hook runs, %Initialize will have finished executing,
and %Callback is no longer defined.

<h2>Local Types</h2>

Like subroutines, you can also define types locally.

To enable the feature, use <tt>{Option} LocalTypes(1)</tt>.
Then, define types using <tt>Local Struct...</tt>.

For example:

| Option LocalTypes(1)
| Function MakePair(x,y)
|   Local Struct Pair
|     X, Y
|   EndStruct
|   Dim a As Pair
|   a->X := x
|   a->Y := y
|   Return a
| EndFunction

<h2>Types are Functions</h2>

The documented way to define an instance of a type is <tt>Dim...As</tt>.
| Struct Coord
|   X, Y
| EndStruct
| Dim pos As Coord

Defining such a structure actually just defines a <em>constructor function</em> named the same as the type.
Thus, you can also create instances of a type by using a function call:
| Dim pos2 := Coord()
| pos := Coord()

The advantage of this notation is that you can use it everywhere, not just in %Dim statements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@page int:appendix:rationale, Rationale
@in group:int:appendix

This section explains the ideas behind the scripting language, and why things are as they are.

<h2>BASICoid syntax</h2>

The language syntax vaguely resembles BASIC.

In the beginning, there was the report and query language.
Essentially, we have three major language families to choose from,
and BASIC turns out to be the easiest one for a report and query language.
Here's a sample expression:
| Owner=My.Race And Orbit.Enemy
In Pascal style, we'd need additional parentheses, and in C style, we'd have to use "strange" operators
(remember our audience is not just programmers):
| (Owner=My.Race) And Orbit.Enemy
| Owner==My.Race && Owner.Enemy

All this completely neglects the underlying language's type system and naming rules.
Here, BASIC wins again by being so un-standardized in that area that it doesn't hurt when we add a new dialect :-)
Besides, I never claimed this to be BASIC.

However, since PCC2 does byte-compilation, it's now possible to add different front-ends with little effort.

<h2>Untypedness</h2>

The language is untyped, i.e. it does not require programmers to declare what
types of values they want to store in variables.

Besides this being the de-facto standard in scripting languages,
a 100% requirement for the language was to have the notion of an unknown value (EMPTY).
So, even if we'd allow variables that always contain numbers, they'd have to be able to accept numbers-or-EMPTY.
Allowing it to accept numbers-or-EMPTY-or-anything-else just makes not much of a difference.

<h2>Dynamic Scope</h2>

Dynamic scope means a name is looked up in its current execution context,
and needn't be declared in the function it's used in.

This allows many useful features, such as searching for units owned by player 2
by using the expression <tt>Owner$=2</tt>, and have PCC automatically select
ship, planet, or other context.

In PCC 1.x, dynamic scope is the only way to pass values back from a function,
without completely reverting to global variables. This is required by things like <tt>{UI.Input}</tt>.
Although PCC2 allows functions, it keeps this model of user-interface interaction.
