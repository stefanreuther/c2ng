PCC2ng NEWS FILE
================

2.41.3
------

  Add translation.

  Added some more attributes to script objects (e.g. InMsg().Link), to
  allow the c2play-server to publish those, and eventually allow
  adding more features to the Web client.

  Reworked network play. For PlanetsCentral, the whole game directory
  is now taken from the server, and can be accessed by scripts as
  using file name "game:whatever.txt".

  Add ability to interrupt running scripts (Ctrl+Break).


2.41.2
------

  Client features:
  - Build Queue Dialog: show build queue positions graphically;
  - Imperial Stats: show planets by experience;
  - Ship Missions: filter by category;
  - Starchart: show actual (not estimated) flight times for distance;
  - Auto Task: build base, factories, hulls, etc.;
  - VCR: export and save.

  History viewing is more consistent; scripts and actions access
  viewpoint turn.

  Several minor fixes.


2.41.1
------

  Client features: exit confirmation. Receive attachments. Relative
  (percentage) population growth display. Alliances in simulator.

  In addition, lots of bugfixes and small improvements that PCC2 got
  in the meantime.

  Major fixes: Linux SSL code was unstable, causing crashes when
  talking to PlanetsCentral. Windows network code was accidentally
  built without compression support, causing communication with
  Planets.nu to fail.

----

  Client reaches practical feature parity with PCC1/PCC2; only minor
  details missing. Features added: configuration dialog and plugin
  manager. Messenger features, in particular, VPA data transmissions.
