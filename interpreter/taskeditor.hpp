    /** Auto Task editor.
        Translates a process into an editable string list and back.

        An auto task is presented to the user as a list of commands (strings).
        A user program counter identifies the line currently being worked on.
        Execution may be beginning at that line, or have already started; see isInSubroutineCall().

        In addition, a TaskEditor maintains a cursor.
        This is a feature of the task editor user interface;
        having it here reduces the number of abstractions to deal with.

        Internally, task commands are compiled into a sequence of interpreter instructions:
        - regular commands produce
            pushlit 'the command'
            pushlit CC$AUTOEXEC
            callind 1
        - the 'restart' command produces
             pushlit CC$AUTORECHECK
             callind 0
             j #0

        TaskEditor converts to and from this format.

        TaskEditor implements Process::Freezer and will freeze the process being edited.
        This means there can be at most one TaskEditor for each process,
        and only suspended processes can be edited.

        If you wish to edit a process that is already being edited,
        you can obtain the TaskEditor created by someone else.
        To manage lifetime, TaskEditor implements RefCounted. */
