        A process executes script commands.
        It holds all required state, namely:
        - identifying information (name, Id, etc.)
        - active stack frames with their local variables
        - active contexts
        - active exception handlers

        Execution of multiple processes is coordinated by ProcessList which also creates Process objects.

        To execute script code, create a Process object (e.g. using ProcessList::create()),
        push a frame (pushFrame()), and execute it (e.g. using ProcessList::run() or run()).

        Unless the process is executing code that refers to transient state (e.g. GUI objects),
        it can be suspended to disk (see SaveContext) and later reloaded.
        This is mainly used for auto-tasks.

        c2ng no longer includes the ability to execute temporary processes (runTemporary). */
