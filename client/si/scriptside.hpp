        This object is accessible as a Session extra.

        Essentially, ScriptSide is to UserSide what a Trampoline is to most proxy classes.
        However, ScriptSide needs to be accessible from scripts.

        One major pattern is
        - call executeTaskWait or continueProcessWait to start a script process and associate a waitId with it
        - receive onTaskComplete() callback with the waitId */
